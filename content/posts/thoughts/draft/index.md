What is opinion?

> a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge

This is the definition getting pulled straight out of a dictionary, it is one's view on something, standing from a subjective point in the whole thing, saying whatever is on his head, not important if it is right or wrong, if he truly thinks so, it is his opinion

the thing is, in the very ideal that I follow - epistemonology - such a thing is by its definition: unreliable, because it is drawn from the very conclusion that one evaluates based on a set of inputs that his brain works out to be of a pattern he's seen before, and from that he states out his view

my problem with opinion (is it even a problem?) is that it's unreliable, so unreliable that if the whole corporation is based on one view of something and on his decision alone that drives the plans and operations of that corp in a foreseeable time range, I don't think he can carry that responsibility on his shoulders

but what is worse is, if I pull the scope out and see it with a bigger picture, everything is a series of opinions, each and every decision that is made by consensus of a committee is not guaranteed to be reliable, they are a composition of "opinions" that are trusted to be true, that they will work. Behind every corporation decision is not a super terrestial computer that is able to analyze based on what it has not been trained with and produce a vector of direction that other can reliably trust to implement, well, at least with a percentage of confidence

opinions are personal by default

what I think I want to express in this article is that opinion is very important in our life, and I meant it not in a group-beneficial, for-a-greater good kind of importance, but more of a identity, proving who you are type of thing, while being neutral and depending on the situation to do the solving and decision making is great, it to me doesnt strike as
