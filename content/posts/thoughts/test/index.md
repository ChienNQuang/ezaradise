Almost every arguments I'm in have the question: "What's your definition of X?".
The definition of something is important

Definition doesn't have to be precisely right, everyone has their own definition of something
When refer to something, we need to have the definition, it's up to whether one's definition is abstract or concrete that what he mean is different

Albeit in the context of technical details, business, or just arguing something

To me, the moment I was asked the definition of something is the moment I need to either

- if the definition shows up in my head in either written/auditory form, I can just read them out
- I need to put everything I know about it, in some concise wording ways that is
  - able to communicate what I really mean by saying it
  - not wrong

To improve it, reread the note is very important

I used to have one experience like that with the Repository Pattern

The definition help you reference to all the closely related points
